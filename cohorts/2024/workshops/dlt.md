# Open source data ingestion for RAGs with dlt

In this hands-on workshop, we’ll learn how to build a data ingestion pipeline using dlt to load data from a REST API into LanceDB so you can have an always up to date RAG.

​We’ll cover the following steps:

* Extract data from REST APIs
* Loading and vectorizing into LanceDB
* Incremental loading

​By the end of this workshop, you’ll be able to write a data pipeline for your RAG.
