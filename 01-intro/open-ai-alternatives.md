# OpenAI API Alternatives

OpenAI and GPT are not the only hosted LLMs that we can use. 
There are other services that we can use

Let's build a list of such services that we can use instead of OpenAI


* [mistral.ai](mistral.ai) (5â‚¬ free credit on sign up)
* [console.groq.com](Groq) (can inference from open source LLMs with rate limits)
* [api.together.ai](TogetherAI) (can inference from variety of open source LLMs, 25$ free credit on sign up)
* [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/get-started/tutorial?lang=python) (2 months unlimited access)
